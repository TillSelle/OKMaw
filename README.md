# OKMaw
## What is currently implemented?
* Menu Tab with switchable modes and toggle on/off
* * Working for Killstealer
* Rough Damage Calculation of W Damage, Q Damage, E Damage, R Damage
* * Still kinda buggy always gets lower results than the actual damage...
* Killsteal with Q,E,R (and AA... Probably || edit: AA not working yet...)
* Calculation of IsKillable (dependable since Calc result is lower damage than it actually does)
* Imo actually useful with something like SixAIO and EB prediction
* Console Debugging (non-optional)
## Soon to be implemented
* Completely working menu
* Better Damage Calculation
* Autocast for all Spells (InCombo/InRange modes)
* Mana Limiter for spell casting
* Killsteal Drawings
* Optional Console Debugging

I have to play around with the current prediction a lil bit.
Small unfinished League of Legends Champ Module. With Prediction for casting Q,E,R.<br>
